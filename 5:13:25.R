# question 1
# primary keys <- CUST_NO and ADDRESS, ORDER_NO and CUST_NO,
# PROD_NO and COLOR, ORDER_NO and QUANTITY.
# foreign keys <- NAME, CUST_NO, PROD_NO

# question 2
# schema <- CUSTOMER(CUST_NO, NAME, ADDRESS)

# question 3
# CUST_NO is a foreign key in CUSTOMER so it violates referential integrity.

# question 4
# domain <- QUANTITY <10, 10, 20, 05, 05>
# domain <- ORDER_NO <01, 02, 02, 09, 010>
